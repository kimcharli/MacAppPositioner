## ðŸš§ CURRENT PHASE: User Interface Development

### Phase 2: SwiftUI Interface
- [ ] **UI Architecture Planning**
    - [ ] Design SwiftUI app structure (separate from CLI tool)
    - [ ] Plan data flow between UI and core logic
    - [ ] Design user experience for profile management
- [ ] **Core UI Components**
    - [ ] Profile list view with current/available profiles
    - [ ] Profile application controls with status feedback
    - [ ] Monitor setup visualization/detection display
    - [ ] Settings/preferences interface
- [ ] **Profile Management UI**
    - [ ] Create new profile interface
    - [ ] Edit existing profiles (rename, modify layout)
    - [ ] Delete profiles with confirmation
    - [ ] Import/export profile configurations
- [ ] **Real-time Features**
    - [ ] Live monitor detection and display
    - [ ] Application status indicators (running/not running)
    - [ ] Window positioning preview/validation
- [ ] **Integration**
    - [ ] Connect SwiftUI interface with existing core logic
    - [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with CLI tool
    - [ ] Share configuration files between UI and CLI versions

## ðŸ“‹ UPCOMING PHASES

### Phase 3: Menu Bar App
- [ ] **Menu Bar Integration**
    - [ ] Convert SwiftUI app to menu bar application
    - [ ] Create menu bar icon and menu structure
    - [ ] Quick profile switching from menu bar
    - [ ] Status indicators in menu bar
- [ ] **Background Operation**
    - [ ] Run silently in background
    - [ ] Minimize memory footprint
    - [ ] Handle system sleep/wake events
- [ ] **Keyboard Shortcuts**
    - [ ] Global hotkeys for profile switching
    - [ ] Customizable keyboard shortcuts
    - [ ] Conflict detection with system shortcuts

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Remaining)
- [ ] **Layout Snapshots**
    - [ ] Capture current window positions across all monitors  
    - [ ] Save captured layout as new profile
    - [ ] Smart application detection and bundle ID resolution
    - [ ] Handle applications with multiple windows
- [ ] **Dynamic Profile Management**
    - [ ] Auto-create profiles when new monitor setups detected
    - [ ] Smart profile suggestions based on usage patterns
    - [ ] Profile templates for common setups (laptop only, dual monitor, etc.)
- [ ] **Advanced Positioning**
    - [ ] Custom positioning beyond quadrants (percentage-based, absolute coordinates)
    - [ ] Window sizing in addition to positioning  
    - [ ] Support for multiple windows per application
    - [ ] Application-specific positioning strategies and rules

### Phase 5: Polish and Distribution

## ðŸ“Š PROGRESS SUMMARY

**Current State:** Fully functional command-line application
- âœ… Core window positioning engine complete
- âœ… Multi-monitor support working
- âœ… Configuration system robust and flexible
- âœ… Documentation comprehensive
- âœ… Ready for GUI development

**Next Priority:** SwiftUI interface development to make the application accessible to non-technical users

**Architecture Decision:** Keep CLI tool available while adding GUI - both interfaces can share the same core logic classes.
