## âœ… RECENTLY COMPLETED: Native Cocoa Coordinate System & GUI Implementation

    - [x] Completely eliminated all custom coordinate conversions (removed Canonical* files)
    - [x] Refactored to use direct NSScreen.frame usage throughout
    - [x] Implemented proper Accessibility API coordinate conversion at system boundary only
    
- [x] **Terminology Standardization**
    - [x] Replaced all "primary" references with "workspace" to avoid NSScreen.main confusion
    - [x] Updated config.json with workspace/builtin monitor distinction
    - [x] Added proper CodingKeys enum to Layout struct for JSON mapping
    
- [x] **Critical Bug Fixes**
    - [x] Fixed workspace monitor detection bug (was using first profile instead of specified profile)
    - [x] Resolved Chrome positioning on wrong monitor issue
    - [x] Implemented exact corner positioning with no padding using actual window dimensions
    - [x] Fixed Accessibility API coordinate conversion for workspace monitor (negative Y coordinates)
    - [x] Documented all coordinate system issues and fixes in COORDINATE_SYSTEM_ISSUES.md

### Complete Project Structure Overhaul âœ…
- [x] **Swift Project Standards Implementation**
    - [x] Reorganized to Scripts/ folder for build scripts (build.sh, build-gui.sh)
    - [x] Created Tests/ folder for all test files
    - [x] Added dist/ folder for compiled binaries
    - [x] Cleaned up root directory following Swift Package Manager conventions
    
- [x] **Obsolete Code Removal**
    - [x] Removed all Canonical* coordinate system files
    - [x] Cleaned up test_ files and moved remaining to Tests/ folder
    - [x] Removed CanonicalMain.swift and updated CLI to CocoaMain.swift
    - [x] Updated all documentation to remove Canonical references

### Phase 2: Complete SwiftUI GUI Implementation âœ…
- [x] **SwiftUI App Target Complete**
    - [x] Created full SwiftUI application with App.swift and ContentView.swift
    - [x] Implemented all core GUI components (MonitorVisualizationView, ProfileManagerView, SettingsView)
    - [x] Fixed GUI compilation errors after coordinate system changes
    - [x] Verified GUI uses native Cocoa coordinate system throughout
    
- [x] **Basic Profile Interface Complete**
    - [x] Display list of available profiles with current/active profile indication
    - [x] Functional "Apply Profile" buttons with real-time status feedback
    - [x] Monitor setup visualization showing current configuration
    
- [x] **GUI-CLI Integration Verified**
    - [x] Confirmed GUI uses same ProfileManager, CoordinateManager core logic
    - [x] Tested both CLI and GUI work simultaneously without conflicts
    - [x] Validated shared config.json usage between interfaces

**Result**: Both CLI and GUI applications fully functional with native Cocoa coordinate system

## ðŸ“Š PROGRESS SUMMARY

**Current State:** Complete dual-interface application with native Cocoa coordinate system

- âœ… **Native Cocoa coordinate system** implemented following Apple's official standards
- âœ… **Both CLI and GUI applications** fully functional and battle-tested
- âœ… **Exact window positioning** with zero padding and proper coordinate conversion
- âœ… **Multi-monitor support** with workspace/builtin monitor distinction
- âœ… **Project structure** organized following Swift Package Manager conventions
- âœ… **Comprehensive documentation** including coordinate system issue reference
- âœ… **Clean codebase** with all obsolete coordinate conversion code removed

**Next Priority:** Enhanced profile management and layout snapshots

**Architecture Achievement:** Native Cocoa coordinate system provides precise, reliable positioning while CLI and GUI share identical core logic (CocoaProfileManager, CocoaCoordinateManager, ConfigManager) ensuring consistent behavior across interfaces.

**Key Technical Success:** Resolved all coordinate system confusion by implementing Apple's native Cocoa standard, eliminating custom conversions, and achieving exact corner positioning through proper Accessibility API boundary conversion.
