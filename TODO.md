## âœ… RECENTLY COMPLETED: Project Restructure

### Project Architecture Restructure âœ…
- [x] **Code Reorganization for Multi-Interface Support**
    - [x] Move shared core logic to `MacAppPositioner/Shared/` directory
    - [x] Separate CLI-specific code to `MacAppPositioner/CLI/` directory  
    - [x] Update build.sh to use new directory structure
    - [x] Test CLI functionality after restructure
    - [x] Verify all commands work with new architecture

**Result**: Project now ready for GUI development while maintaining CLI functionality

## ðŸš§ CURRENT PHASE: SwiftUI Interface Development

### Phase 2A: Minimal Viable GUI (Next Steps)
- [ ] **Add SwiftUI App Target**
    - [ ] Create new SwiftUI target in Xcode project
    - [ ] Configure target to import Shared classes
    - [ ] Create basic App.swift and ContentView.swift
- [ ] **Basic Profile Interface**
    - [ ] Display list of available profiles
    - [ ] Show currently detected/active profile
    - [ ] Add "Apply Profile" buttons with status feedback
- [ ] **Test GUI-CLI Integration**
    - [ ] Verify GUI can use ProfileManager, WindowManager, etc.
    - [ ] Test that both CLI and GUI work simultaneously
    - [ ] Validate shared config.json usage

### Phase 2B: Enhanced GUI Features  
- [ ] **UI Architecture Planning**
    - [x] Design SwiftUI app structure (separate from CLI tool) - COMPLETED via restructure
    - [x] Plan data flow between UI and core logic - COMPLETED via Shared classes
    - [ ] Design user experience for profile management
- [ ] **Core UI Components**
    - [ ] Profile list view with current/available profiles
    - [ ] Profile application controls with status feedback
    - [ ] Monitor setup visualization/detection display
    - [ ] Settings/preferences interface
- [ ] **Profile Management UI**
    - [ ] Create new profile interface
    - [ ] Edit existing profiles (rename, modify layout)
    - [ ] Delete profiles with confirmation
    - [ ] Import/export profile configurations
- [ ] **Real-time Features**
    - [ ] Live monitor detection and display
    - [ ] Application status indicators (running/not running)
    - [ ] Window positioning preview/validation
- [ ] **Integration**
    - [ ] Connect SwiftUI interface with existing core logic
    - [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with CLI tool
    - [ ] Share configuration files between UI and CLI versions

## ðŸ“‹ UPCOMING PHASES

### Phase 3: Menu Bar App
- [ ] **Menu Bar Integration**
    - [ ] Convert SwiftUI app to menu bar application
    - [ ] Create menu bar icon and menu structure
    - [ ] Quick profile switching from menu bar
    - [ ] Status indicators in menu bar
- [ ] **Background Operation**

## ðŸ“Š PROGRESS SUMMARY

**Current State:** CLI application with GUI-ready architecture
- âœ… Core window positioning engine complete and battle-tested
- âœ… Multi-monitor support working across diverse setups
- âœ… Configuration system robust and flexible
- âœ… Documentation comprehensive (6 detailed guides)
- âœ… **Project restructured for multi-interface support**
- âœ… **Shared core logic separated from CLI-specific code**
- âœ… **Ready for immediate GUI development**

**Next Priority:** SwiftUI interface (Phase 2A) - Add app target and basic profile UI

**Architecture Advantage:** CLI and GUI will share identical core logic (WindowManager, ProfileManager, CoordinateManager, ConfigManager) while providing different user experiences.
